## 10/4/2025 - Finished Schematic

- Relearned 1 bit memory(thought that base goes to ground :( )
- Designed PCB
- Found tht parts to use that would be easy for newbies to solder!
- Using PCB edge USB-A Connector, gold
- No PCB art... unless I decide to learn :D
- Will have breadboard area! Currently 5x7 but most likely will increase it.
  

## 10/5/2025 - Routed PCB, MVP

- Routed PCB
- Researched what fabrication needed(too poor for 2.0)
- Added site & silkscreen(art next maybe?)
- Sanity check :D
- Silkscreen has all information necessary
Entered into JLCPCB, it is under the budget! Most likely will order a small batch before getting the 30 I originally wanted. 
  

## 10/9/2025 - Setup Cart

Project is ready! I ordered 1.6mm and black since it is cheaper. Eventually, I will put in a 3d printed piece at the end. The 3d printed piece will be only for the usb edge part so it friction fits into female USB-A ports. I also ordered ENIG for durability.
