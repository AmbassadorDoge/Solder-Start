# Solder-Start

### Description

A USB powered breadboard and 1-bit memory! It also acts as a 5v power supply. I hope to inspire others to learn to solder with this.

### To Make

I will buy from JLCPCB. If you are also getting from a PCB manufacturer, use the following tips:
- Use ENIG and Gold fingers(has USB-A PCB edge!)
- When it arrives, put something ~0.5mm on the bottom of the USB part of the PCB to make sure it fits nicely onto any port.
